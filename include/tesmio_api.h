// tesmio_api.h - the contract between tesmioloader and a plugin.
//
// A plugin is an ordinary DLL in tesmioloader\plugins\. The loader finds it,
// checks that it was built against a compatible version of this header, and
// hands it a table of the things the loader already knows how to do: where the
// executable is, how to patch an import, how to splice a hook, how to log, and
// what deposits.ini declared.
//
// Everything crossing the boundary is a POD or a C string. No CRT object, no
// allocation ownership, no C++ type. The loader and every plugin are built
// /MT, so each has its own CRT and nothing may be freed across the boundary.
//
//   #include "../../src/tesmio_api.h"
//
//   static const TsmHost* g_host;
//
//   extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) unsigned TsmPluginApiVersion(void)
//   {
//       return TSM_API_VERSION;
//   }
//
//   extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) int TsmPluginInit(const TsmHost* host, TsmPluginInfo* info)
//   {
//       g_host = host;
//       info->name    = "example";
//       info->version = "1.0";
//       g_host->log("example  hello from a plugin");
//       return 0;                       // non-zero means "do not keep me loaded"
//   }
//
// Pointers handed out by the host stay valid for the life of the process.
//
// INIT AND START ARE TWO PHASES, and the split is what makes one plugin able to
// use another without either knowing the load order:
//
//   TsmPluginInit    read your config, and `provide` whatever interfaces you
//                    publish. Do not `consume` and do not hook anything.
//   TsmPluginStart   `consume` what you need and install your hooks. Every
//                    plugin's Init has run by the time any Start does.
//
// Start is optional. A plugin that depends on nothing can do everything in
// Init - depletion consumes the deposit registry, so it does not.

// Bumped whenever anything below changes at all - a new field, a new service, a
// new constant. It is what a plugin reports back through TsmPluginApiVersion,
// and it is how the host knows what that plugin was built to expect.
#define TSM_API_VERSION 3u

// The oldest plugin this host still initialises, and the whole of the
// compatibility promise: the host accepts anything in
//
//     TSM_API_VERSION_MIN <= reported <= TSM_API_VERSION
//
// **KEEPING AN OLD PLUGIN WORKING IS A REQUIREMENT, NOT A COURTESY.** A change
// to this header that does not have to break one must not break one, and
// raising this number is the admission that it did. A plugin is a DLL somebody
// downloaded; the source it was built from may not exist any more, and a host
// that refuses everything on every release turns each version bump into a
// re-release of the whole ecosystem.
//
// A change is COMPATIBLE - bump TSM_API_VERSION, leave this alone - when a
// plugin built against any accepted older version still reads exactly the bytes
// it was compiled to read:
//
//   * a new field APPENDED to the very end of TsmHost. structSize is what an
//     older host is detected by, and an old plugin never looks that far
//   * a new #define, a new service name, a new TsmDepositApi-style interface
//   * a new optional export the host calls only when GetProcAddress finds it
//   * a new value of an existing enum-like field that older plugins can only
//     fail to recognise, never misread
//
// A change is BREAKING - raise this to the new TSM_API_VERSION - when it makes
// an old plugin read the wrong bytes or act on the wrong promise:
//
//   * moving, removing, reordering or retyping ANY field of TsmHost or of any
//     struct that crosses the boundary. Inserting a field in the middle is the
//     classic one, and it is silent: every field after it shifts
//   * changing what an existing function does, what it returns, when it may be
//     called, or which phase it belongs to
//   * changing the meaning of a value a plugin already passes or reads
//
// The range is deliberately one-sided. A plugin reporting MORE than
// TSM_API_VERSION is always refused: it was built against a header this host
// does not have, so it may read a field off the end of the table it was handed.
//
// A plugin that wants a field added after its own version must check
// TsmHost::structSize before touching it - that is what the field is for, and
// it is the only way an old plugin can use a new host's extras.
